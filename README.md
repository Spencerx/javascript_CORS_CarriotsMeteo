http://demo.carriots.com/meteocarriots/index.html

You can play with the data using the Carriots API and an open data feed.

There is a device available at Carriots where data streams are sent and can be used for your own purposes. Here are the details:

    Device ID developer: madrid@carriotsMeteo.carriotsMeteo
    Read-only apikey: a3dd2a33c514de9ed0ad1e8e751a82a8c699916858b1ad0a6e2425d71cce48ea
    REST request URL (GET stream list):
    http://api.carriots.com/devices/madrid@carriotsMeteo.carriotsMeteo/streams/

How to query Carriots API to request data is detailed in our documentation page https://www.carriots.com/documentation/api/data_management#s-list and in this example.
